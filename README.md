# Team Member Allocation App

The Team Member Allocation App is a simple web application that allows you to manage team members and their allocations to different teams. The app is built using React and utilizes local storage to persist the team member data across sessions.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following files:

1. **App.jsx**: The main entry point of the application. It manages the state of selected team and employees, and handles the logic for team and employee selection.

2. **Employees.jsx**: This component displays the list of team members and allows the user to switch between teams. It utilizes the **Teams** and **TeamMembers** components.

3. **Footer.jsx**: A simple footer component that displays the app name and the current year.

4. **GroupedTeamMembers.jsx**: This component displays the team members grouped by teams. It allows the user to collapse and expand each team's member list.

5. **Header.jsx**: The header component that displays the app title and the selected team's member count.

6. **index.jsx**: The main entry point to render the React app and apply strict mode.

7. **Nav.jsx**: A navigation component that provides links to different sections of the app.

8. **NotFound.jsx**: A simple 404 page component for handling undefined routes.

9. **TeamMemberCard.jsx**: A reusable card component to display individual team member details.

10. **TeamMembers.jsx**: A component that iterates through the list of employees and renders individual **TeamMemberCard** components for each team member.

11. **Teams.jsx**: A dropdown component that allows the user to select different teams.

## How the Files Work Together

1. **App.jsx** is the main component that sets up the overall structure of the app. It defines the routing using **react-router-dom** and manages the state of the selected team and employees.

2. **Employees.jsx** is a child component of **App.jsx** that displays the team member cards and team selection dropdown. It uses **Teams.jsx** and **TeamMembers.jsx** components to render the team selection and member cards, respectively.

3. **GroupedTeamMembers.jsx** is a separate page component that displays team members grouped by teams. It uses **employees** and **selectedTeam** states to display the relevant data.

4. **Header.jsx** and **Footer.jsx** are simple components that display the header and footer of the app, respectively. They are included in the main **App.jsx** component.

5. **Nav.jsx** provides navigation links to the main page and the grouped team members page. It is also included in the **App.jsx** component.

6. **NotFound.jsx** is a fallback component for handling undefined routes.

7. **TeamMemberCard.jsx** is a reusable component to display individual team member details. It is used by **TeamMembers.jsx** to render each team member card.

8. **TeamMembers.jsx** maps through the list of employees and renders individual **TeamMemberCard** components for each team member.

9. **Teams.jsx** is a dropdown component that allows the user to select different teams. It is used in **Employees.jsx** to manage team selection.
